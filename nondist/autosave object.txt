autosave points are loaded on a per map basis similar to doors

has the following struct

struct autosavePoint
{
	int nX;			//tile x coord
	int nY;			//tile x coord
	int nActive;		//==1 if this autosave is used on this map
}

Needs a retrace hook to check if the player stepped on a save point

void CheckAutoSave(int i)
{
	if autosave[i].nActive AND autosave[i] X coord == player X/16 AND autosave[i] Y coord == player Y/16
	{
		Quicksave();
		autosave[i].nActive = 0;	//set it's active to 0, therby killing it
	}
}

add autosave array to savegames
