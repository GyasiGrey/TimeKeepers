Time Travel - Made possible by the Bad Lands. Tech engineered and built all the technology that allows a living being to time travel through the use of the bad lands. It has yet to be completely tested, but has been accurate and reliable so far.

Chrono Tube - Anything in this gets sent through time. It also makes puffs of smoke. It has the ability to send anything inside back in time, but not forward. It can also change the location of the time traveler once they have moved through time. Once a time traveler travels to a new time they can return to their own time only by going to the point where they entered.

Time Hole - Tech's time travel technology has the side effect of leaving a tiny, almost unnoticable hole in time. This hole leads back to the point  where the time traveler originally came from.

Robots - Commercially available robots used for training and defense. Currently come in two flavors.
	-Bipedal - Commonly used for training because of their resemblance to humans. They tend to be equiped with light arms (pistols, shotguns).
	
	-Tracked - Used for defense because of their increased mobility and weapons capacity. Has a machine gun mounted on the top of its body.
